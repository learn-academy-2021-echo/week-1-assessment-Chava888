# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer:
Git is a repository track file system, meaning a git is created to track changes, updates, deletion of files. It allows for more than one coder to work on the same code by creating different branches, alterante paths, to work independently in the code and later on merge the changes to a single main path.

  Researched answer:
Git is a version control system that allows many coders to work on the same code. 
Github is a internet service provider that host version control using Git.



2. What types of evaluations will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer:
Conditional statements will return a boolean value, "true" and "false". The conditional statements use syntax such as if,
elseif, else and  &&, ||, <, >. 

  Researched answer:
Conditional statements and use of equiality operators will result in boolean values.


3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer:
  Index is the location of an instance of an array or location of a character within a string while value is the actual element/item that is stored in the index.

  Researched answer:
Index is the location of an element within an array. The differences between index and value is that index provides the location of an element while value provides the content in that element.


4. What is iteration?

  Your answer:
The repeat of executing a set of instructions that is based on a set of code. 

  Researched answer:

  The repeation of performing an action a number of times until a certain condition is met.


5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Pair programming consists of a driver and a navigator. The driver is the person that is typing the code in the local computer while taking instructions from the navigator. The navigator is the individual that is providing the set of instructions to the driver to type the code. The implimentation of pair programming allows for two individuals to check and discuss the code and solve any blockers while creating the code. 

  Researched answer:
Pair programming is having two individuals working in the same code. One person operating the keyboard, known as the driver, while the other person watches and navigates the driver while working on the code. The driver mainly focuses on making sure the syntax of the code is written properly while the navigator focus on the more abstract of the code to deliver the proper results.

Proper pair programming techniques is having both individuals be prepared, open line of communication, both persons need to be engage while coding, switch roles at certain time intervals. 


6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer:
The habit of repetition to start muscle memory which helps in learning new topics such as github.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. GitHub pull request:
A notification method that notifies others that a change has been done to a branch, and requesting permission to merge the changes to the base branch (typically main branch). The reviewer then reviews the changes and collaborates with the others prior to approving the pull request. Once the request is approved then the changes would be merged with the main branch.

2. Higher Order Functions:
Functions that take in functions as arguments or returns another function as output. Examples of higher order functions are
map() and filter() that require an input argument function. In some sense is h(x)=g(f(x)).


3. Jest:
Is a javascript testing framework that test code. This framework can be used to do quality assurance of our code to make sure the code is running properly.

4. Objects:
Objects are datatype that contain collections of keys and values. Objects may contain properties and methods.
An example of an object is

let car = {
model: "ford",
year: 1998
}

To extract properties or methods within an object we need to use the keys for access. Example would be 
car.model would extract the value "ford".

5. Classes:
Classes are blueprints for objects which means classes are used as templates to create new objects. Classes is a type of function that contain data and behavior, and considered reusable. Classes are used to create independent objects that contain properties and methods.
